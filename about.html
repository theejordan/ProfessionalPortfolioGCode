        <h2 class="about">Hi! ðŸ¤Ž</h2>
        <p id="paragraph">I'm Jordan Jazmine Clarke also known as Jo! I'm genuinely thrilled to share my journey into coding web development. At the moment, I find myself diving headfirst into a 12-week Intro to Web Development program with G{code}. This is my first real encounter with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's both challenging and exciting.

          As I navigate through these classes, I'm gaining knowledge that's helping me reach for goals I never thought were within my grasp. I'm a complete newbie on this path of switching careers, but I'm genuinely looking forward to sharing more about myself and the work I'm doing. So, stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the journey with me! âœ¨
